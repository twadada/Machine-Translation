# Machine-Translation

Chainer-based implementation of neural machine translation model with attention mecanism.[Luong et al., 2015]

## About
This software is a Chainer-based implementation of a neural machine translation (NMT) model with attention mechanism. More specifically, it uses bidirectional LSTMs as an encoder and a single LSTM as a decoder. For the attention mechanism, it uses general attention proposed by [Luong et al., 2015]. Sentences of the same length are grouped into each mini-batch to avoid padding.

## Requirement

Python version: 

- Python3

To run the models, you need following packages

- os
- numpy
- chainer (version > 2.0)
- pickle
- argparse
- tqdm
- time
- collections
- itertools
- warnings

If you use GPU, you also need 

- cupy

If you want to output attention weight heat map during test, you also need

- matplotlib
- seaborn
- PyPDF2

## Usage

First, you need to pre-process train and development data using Preprocess.py. To run this file, set one of these three pairs of options:

- -src_min and -tgt_min (default: 5)
- -srcV and -tgtV (default: None)
- -src_vocab and -tgt_vocab (default: None)

The first options specify the cutoff word frequency; that is, only the words that appear at least the cutoff times in train data are included in vocabulary. The second options specify the size of source and target vocabulary. In the last options, you can pass the paths of vocabulary files (.txt) that contain each word in vocabulary line by line.

For instance, run the followings:

```
python Preprocess.py -src_train source_train_path -tgt_train target_train_path -src_dev source_development_path -tgt_dev target_development_path -save_name save_name -src_min 7 -tgt_min 5
```

This outputs "data/save_name.data" and "data/save_name.vocab_dict". These files are to be used during training/testing. If you also want to output source and target vocabulary txt files, enable -output_vocab.


If you do not have any development data, you can omit -src_dev and -tgt_dev options. However, it is highly recommended to prepare these data as to train models efficiently and select the best model after training. 


After pre-processing, you can train an NMT model as follows:

```
python train.py -save_name save_name -epoch_size 10 -opt_type Adam -gpuid 0 
```

This file outputs a trained model in "Results" directory at every epoch. If development data is given, perplexity (ppl) on the data is calculated at every epoch. The value of ppl is described in the model name. Enable -remove_models option to keep only the model that has achieved the best perplexity on development data. If you omit -gpuid option, CPU is used instead. For other options, use -h option and see usage messages. 

Once training is done, you can select a model and translate test data as follows:

```
python translate.py -model model_path -src_test test_data_path -gpuid 0 -beam_size 5 
```

This outputs translations as "model_path.translation.txt". You can increase the beam size as much as you want. However, it is known that output translations tend to be shorter and shorter as beam size becomes larger. To mitigate this problem, you can set -normalize option to divide decoding probabilities by sentence length during beam search.

If you also want to output top k translation candidates for each source sentence, set the option -k larger than 1, and it produces another file "model_path.translation_topk.txt". 

If you also want to output attention weight heat map, enable -out_attention_weight. Then, another file "model_path.attn_W.pdf" is generated that illustrates attention weight for each translation.
